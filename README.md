# winnuke
Made to win a CTF in 2009 -  written in MASM using winasm IDE

WinNuke affected the Windows 95, NT & 3.1x by sending a string of OOB (out of band) packet to the target on TCP port 139 causes a Blue Screen of Death. During a local Capture The Flag, one of the flags was to bluescreen a Win95 box, I couldnt find the old code online anywhere , as the websites that hosted most had gone away, so I ended up writing it myself and taking the win by 1 flag.
